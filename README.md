Star Wars Explorer
===============

A django rest app which allows you to collect, resolve and inspect information about characters
in the Star Wars universe from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/)

Setting Up Development Environment
----------------------------------
---

Running Locally
----------------------------------
---

1- create a virtualenv.

2- Activate the virtualenv you have just created.

3- Install development requirements:

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

6- Apply Migrations

    $ python manage.py migrate

7- Run server

    $ python manage.py runserver

8- If you want to run tests locally

    $ python manage.py tests


Using Docker
----------------------------------
---

* Docker; if you donâ€™t have it yet, follow the [installation_instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)

* Docker Compose; refer to the official documentation for the [installation_guilde](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1- Configure your DB, Just go for star_wars_explorer/config/settings/base.py Line 40
Uncomment the two lines 
```python
DATABASES = {"default": env.db("DATABASE_URL")}
DATABASES["default"]["ATOMIC_REQUESTS"] = True
```
then comment those lines 
```python
# DATABASES = {
#      'default': {
#          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#          'NAME': 'mydatabase',
#      }
# }
```

2- go for star_wars_explorer/config/settings/local.py Line 55 and uncomment the following code
```python
 if env("USE_DOCKER") == "yes":
     import socket
 
     hostname, _, ips = socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())
     INTERNAL_IPS += [".".join(ip.split(".")[:-1] + ["1"]) for ip in ips]
```


Then you can build the environment, this can take a while especially the first time you run this particular command on your development system:

    $ make build

That's it!

To run server normally at anytime, just run this command:

    $ make up

To build the app then run server:

    $ make upbuild

To open bash or excute any manage.py commands:

    $ make bash

To create superuser:

    $ make createsuperuser

To make fast migration instead of opening bash:

    $ make makemigrations

    $ make migrate

To run unittests (with running django container):

    $ make test_local

To run unittests (without running django container):

    $ make test

To allow debugging in development with ipdb, run server with this command:

    $ make debug django
